garden - A control program for DotSlashGarden

INTRODUCTION

	garden is a control program for DotSlashGarden, an automated gardening
	project. The goal of DotSlashGarden is to create an indoor hydrogarden that
	requires little to no human intervention. garden simply allows for the 
	control and customization of the automated systems (e.g. lighting, aeration
	pumps, pH monitoring).

DNC (Double New Curses)

	dnc is a component project of garden which provides a text user interface
	for garden's menu system. It is an object-oriented ncurses implementation
	based around the idea of windows.

REQUIREMENTS

	garden is intended to run on Linux, specifically Raspbian and the Raspberry
	Pi. It has not been tested on other systems, so it may not function as
	designed in other situations.

	garden uses ncurses as a part of dnc (Double New Curses). Therefore, ncurses
	libraries must be installed in order for dnc to work.

PROJECT INFORMATION

	garden was started on July 2012. The blog for DotSlashGarden, which includes
