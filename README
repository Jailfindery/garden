garden - A control program for DotSlashGarden

INTRODUCTION

	garden is a control program for DotSlashGarden, an automated gardening
	project. The goal of DotSlashGarden is to create an indoor hydrogarden that
	requires little to no human intervention. garden simply allows for the 
	control and customization of the automated systems (i.e. lighting, aeration
	pumps, pH monitoring). It is meant to be used under Linux and has not been
	tested with other operating systems, although there is no reason it should
	not work under a different OS.

NOTES

	garden is a part of the DotSlashGarden project <dotslashgarden.blogspot.ca>.
