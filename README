garden - A control program for DotSlashGarden

INTRODUCTION

	garden is a control program for DotSlashGarden, an automated gardening
	project. The goal of DotSlashGarden is to create an indoor hydrogarden that
	requires little to no human intervention. garden simply allows for the 
	control and	customization of the automated systems (i.e. lighting, aeration
	pumps, pH monitoring). It is meant to be used under Linux and has not been
	tested with other operating systems.

NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

	As much as this is clich√©, garden is, I hate to say, my very first
	major programming project. Therefore, if you wish to make any changes to
	make it more proper, it would be very much appreciated. The type that
	would make me redo the entire codebase are especially welcome.

	I am also really new to this GitHub thing, so there will probably be some
	weirdness for a while...

USAGE

	To use garden, you will need to compile it from source as no pre-packaged
	binaries exist. You can do this by running `make' with the included makefile.
	There is no fancy configure script or make install thing... yet.

NOTES

	garden is a part of the DotSlashGarden project <dotslashgarden.blogspot.ca>.
